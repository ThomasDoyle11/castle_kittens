# Castle Kittens

This is a selection of files used in the construction of a game tentatively named '**Castle Kittens**', a board game in which kittens roll dice, buy cards and vie for control of the castle, or to be the last kitten standing.

The game is made in Unity using C# scripts.

**The files showcase** my knowledge of object-oriented programming and somewhat primitive UI and asset design.

As this is just an excerpt there will be references to many files I haven't included, and some files will be older versions that may contain errors (purposeful of course, for the reader) however if you have any queries I will be happy to answer them via my email provided on my [Portfolio](https://thomasdoyle11.github.io/).

If you would like to try a working version of the game, contact me via my email ([Portfolio](https://thomasdoyle11.github.io/)) and I can send you a prototype .apk or .exe file for Android or Windows.
